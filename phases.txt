API & Integration Learning Plan (Theory-Focused)
Phase 1: API Fundamentals

Goal: Understand what APIs are and how systems communicate.
Youâ€™ll learn:

What is an API (in plain terms)

REST vs SOAP (structure, format, usage)

HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

Request & Response structure (headers, body, status codes)

API endpoints, base URLs, and routes

Example: How a wearable health device sends data to a web app

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: You can explain how systems talk using APIs, and the flow of data between client, server, and database.

Phase 2: RESTful Design Principles

Goal: Understand REST design, resources, and best practices.
Youâ€™ll learn:

Principles of REST (Stateless, Client-Server, Cacheable)

Resource-based endpoints (/patients, /devices, /readings)

URL naming conventions and versioning

Idempotency and safe HTTP methods

Pagination, filtering, and sorting in APIs

Response formatting (JSON standards, error codes)

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: You can design a clean, professional REST API and explain REST principles clearly in interviews.

Phase 3: Authentication & Authorization

Goal: Learn how APIs stay secure.
Youâ€™ll learn:

API keys, tokens, and sessions

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) â€” structure and usage

OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect basics

Role-based access control (RBAC)

HTTPS and SSL/TLS encryption

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: You can explain how secure APIs protect data and verify users or systems.

Phase 4: Integration Patterns

Goal: Understand how APIs connect systems.
Youâ€™ll learn:

Direct API integration (app â†” API)

Webhooks (event-driven communication)

Middleware and API gateways

Third-party API consumption (e.g., Google Maps, AWS, Stripe)

Rate limiting and throttling

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: You can explain how to integrate different systems or services efficiently.

Phase 5: Error Handling, Monitoring & Versioning

Goal: Learn how APIs are maintained.
Youâ€™ll learn:

Error handling (4xx, 5xx, custom messages)

Logging and API monitoring tools (Postman, Swagger, API Gateway logs)

Versioning strategies (v1, v2)

API documentation and testing

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome: You can describe how to design, maintain, and troubleshoot APIs professionally.

Phase 6: Advanced Topics (Optional but Useful)

Goal: Prepare for real-world & interview depth.
Youâ€™ll learn:

GraphQL vs REST â€” differences and use cases

gRPC (for microservices)

API rate limiting, caching, and load balancing

API orchestration vs choreography (microservices communication)
